So I've lived in the northeast for over a decade, and I've been to NYC countless times over the course of my life. Whether it's just by me or with family (mostly just by me), there are a couple things I really enjoy doing every time and never really get bored of.

You can consider this a travel guide of sorts. If I had a close friend or relative visit the city and ask me for tips, this is what I'd suggest. All images are my own unless otherwise stated.

## Seeing the city from afar

Nothing beats seeing the skyline from afar. And NYC's skyline is *massive*. Often times people from other cities are just looking at downtown or midtown and assume that's the whole thing... then you turn your neck around and see the other half.

There are lots of ways to do this, and there isn't really a bad one. You could walk across a bridge, take a boat ride, pay for a helicopter tour, etc. Even the drive from your airport to your hotel will offer amazing views of the skyline. I've even gotten amazing views of it on flights taking off from NYC. Look at your flight map ahead of time and book the correct window seat. If you're flying out of Newark EWR, a right window seat is usually a good bet.

Up close though, the average person (who doesn't have $$$ to spend on helicopter tours and such) has two awesome options: by bridge and by ferry. Both are great.

### Brooklyn bridge

The Brooklyn bridge is amazing in and of itself, but the views you get while walking down it are even better.
