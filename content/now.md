Currently working on some plant genomics research at UBC involving variant calling in WGS data from mutagenized flax samples.

Finishing up the final semester of my undergrad; mostly the courses for my stats minor. This is what I'm taking:

* STAT 401: Probability and Statistical Inference
* STAT 403: Stochastic Processes
* DATA 407: Sampling and Design
* DATA 410: Regression and Generalized Linear Models
* HEAL 101: Mental Health in Social Contexts (bird course tbh)
* BIOC 495: Biotechnology Laboratory II - Gene Expression

The last one's been pretty fun... it's a ton of plant cell culture techniques and some DNA/RNA expression stuff coming later.

Applying to jobs and post-bacc positions to have something to do after graduation. It still hasn't hit me that I'll soon be saying goodbye to my amazing life here and have to move back home :(
