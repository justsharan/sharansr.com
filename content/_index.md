Hello and welcome to my site (:

I'm Sharan, a recent UBC graduate who studied Microbiology and got a minor in Statistics. I'm also super interested in bioinformatics.

Outside of school, I love to bike, go hiking, discuss politics, cook, and pretty much anything else you'd be into. If any of that sounds interesting, reach out to me on Discord or via email at [sharansr@pm.me](mailto:sharansr@pm.me).

This is a little website where I share things from time to time. It's more of a personal hub or blog than a professional resume/CV website.
