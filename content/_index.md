Hey there! I'm Sharan, a fourth-year undergrad at the University of British Columbia pursuing a major in Microbiology and a minor in Statistics. After university, I hope to pursue further research in bioinformatics or computational biology... or really any field where I can apply my programming know-how to answer questions in the sciences.

This is a nice little site where I emerge out of my cave to write a blog post once or twice a year, share new recipes that I've learned to make (along with my own images), or broadly host other content pertaining to my work and interests.

In my spare time, I love biking and going on hikes, discussing politics, keeping up with F1, and pretty much anything else. If you're at all interested in anything I've mentioned above, feel free to reach out to me via Discord or email me at [sharansr@pm.me](mailto:sharansr@pm.me).
